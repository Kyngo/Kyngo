# Hello! Hola! 👋

- 👽 Who I am: A 26-year-old human being with beard. Sometimes too much beard.
- 💻 What I am: Web, Mobile & Backend Developer / Systems Architect / Dog lover.
- 🌍 Where I am: Barcelona, Spain.
- 🤔 What I do: Code. Systems and Networks. Security. Coffee.

## Brief introduction 🙋🏻‍♂️

I am a person who loves doing new stuff and learning, I can't stop researching and practising what I learn, or even challenging myself to do things that I might fear. I can work both alone and as part of a team, and I can even lead a group of developers without a problem. I can also adapt to different technologies and workflows with ease. I am a little bit socially awkward, though.

I also like dogs. A lot.

And driving (*not to be confused with speeding*). It really helps me relax.
